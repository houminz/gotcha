# Kubernetes Admission Webhook example

This tutoral shows how to build and deploy an [AdmissionWebhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#admission-webhooks).

The Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/) contains a common set of recommended labels that allows tools to work interoperably, describing objects in a common manner that all tools can understand. In addition to supporting tooling, the recommended labels describe applications in a way that can be queried.
In our validating webhook example we make these labels required on deployments and services, so this webhook rejects every deployment and every service that doesnâ€™t have these labels set. The mutating webhook in the example adds all the missing required labels with `not_available` set as the value.

## Prerequisites

Kubernetes 1.9.0 or above with the `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1` API enabled. Verify that by the following command:
```
kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
```
The result should be:
```
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
```

In addition, the `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` and `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` admission controllers should be added and listed in the correct order in the admission-control flag of kube-apiserver.

## Build

Build and push docker image
   
```
./build
```
